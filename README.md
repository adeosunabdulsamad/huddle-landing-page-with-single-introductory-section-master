## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

I need to work on my css flexbox and grid skills. I am also not yet comfortable with positioning in CSS

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_bottom.php) - This helped me out with positioning at the bottom of the website. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-load-and-use-custom-fonts-with-css) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand using custom fonts in CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
